# Autotag for Zotero

Your Zotero library keeps growing.
Your mental map of it quietly collapses.

**Autotag** is a Zotero plugin that helps researchers recover structure and meaning in large literature collections by automatically generating useful, content aware tags directly inside Zotero.

It is built for people who rely on Zotero every day and have reached the point where folders, memory, and manual tagging no longer scale.

## Why this exists

Manual tagging in Zotero has two persistent problems.

**First, it does not scale.**
As the number of items grows, keeping tags consistent becomes increasingly time consuming.

**Second, it drifts.**
Tags created months or years apart stop meaning the same thing. Similar papers end up with different tags, and the tag system slowly loses structure.

This plugin exists because maintaining tags by hand is both exhausting and unreliable over time.

Autotag does not try to invent a new organizational system.
It exists to **remove the burden of manual tagging** while keeping everything inside Zotero.

## What this plugin does

Autotag adds an automatic tagging layer on top of your existing Zotero library.

It allows you to:

• Generate tags automatically based on item metadata and content  
• Apply tags at the collection level instead of one item at a time  
• Keep working fully inside Zotero without exporting data  
• Reduce the cognitive load of maintaining large libraries  

The goal is not to replace your thinking.  
The goal is to remove repetitive and fragile manual work.

## What this plugin does NOT do

To avoid confusion, Autotag does not:

• Replace Zotero’s native tagging system  
• Modify or delete your existing tags  
• Claim perfect or authoritative tagging  
• Act as a recommendation engine or writing assistant  

Think of it as a **supporting tool**, not an oracle.

## Who this is for

This plugin is designed for:

• Graduate students and researchers  
• People managing medium to large Zotero libraries  
• Users who already rely on tags as part of their workflow  
• Zotero users comfortable installing plugins  

If your library is small or you rarely revisit old papers, this may not be useful yet.

## Current status

Project status:

• Core functionality implemented  
• Interfaces and behavior still evolving  
• Expect rough edges and frequent updates  

This is an active research driven project.  
User feedback directly influences future changes.

---

## Roadmap

Planned directions include:

• Improving tag quality and transparency  
• Better controls over tag generation  
• Clearer previews before applying tags  
• Documentation with real research examples  

Details may change as real usage patterns emerge.

## Feedback and contributions

Feedback is highly encouraged.

Especially useful feedback includes:

• Where tagging feels inaccurate or unhelpful  
• What kinds of tags you actually want in practice  
• How this fits or fails in your existing workflow  

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome via issues.

## Motivation

Autotag was built by a researcher for researchers.

It comes from the experience of managing large literature collections where manual organization quietly becomes the bottleneck.

If that resonates with you, you are exactly the audience this plugin was built for.
